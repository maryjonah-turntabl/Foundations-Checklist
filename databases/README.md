## Databases 

1. **I understand the benefits of relational databases and when to use them**
 
    A relational database is a database that allows one to draw the relationship between data objects.  
    The relationship drawn is used to manage and get information anytime a user makes a request.  
    One benefit is when the data to be stored is highly structured and one can easily map a relationship between the objects that make up the data.  
    Data duplication is minimal to non-existent as the data objects are normalized and foreign keys are used represent data that should otherwise have been duplicated.  



3. **I can create a relational database in SQL using an RDBMS CLI client**
